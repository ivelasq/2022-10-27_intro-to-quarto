## Workshop Prep

To follow along with the exercises, please be sure that you:

-   Are on the latest version of RStudio v2022.07 or later and have cloned the exercise repo
-   Or, have a rstudio.cloud account and can access the project
-   And, have a <https://quartopub.com/> account.
:::

::: notes
You have a few options of how to attend this session. One option is that you have a local copy of the exercises already, and when we get to the different sections you can follow along with what I am doing. Another option is that you go into the rstudio.cloud project to follow along. But, please feel free to just watch the session and try things out on your own afterwards. The slides, repository, and project will stay up so that you can try things out on your own time. One other thing to note is that Quarto has a lot of options for creating content, so I added some reference materials in the exercise README so that you can play around with other options other than the ones I show you.

:::{.notes}
Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. Let’s break this down: 
Open-source: RStudio believes that it’s better for everyone if the tools used for research and science are free and open. Free software means more reproducibility, widespread sharing of knowledge and techniques, and elimination of cost barriers. You can also see the source code and contribute, too.
Scientific and technical: Scientific and technical means that Quarto has specific things for journal articles or scientific papers, like support for code execution, citations, footnotes, scientific markdown, equations, citations, crossrefs, so many things. We’ll be showing some of these later on, but Quarto definitely has the scientific publishing audience in mind.
Publishing system: Quarto is a command line interface that creates dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable. Quarto takes rendered plain text like R Markdown files or mixed formats like Jupyter notebooks to create high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more formats.
Pandoc is the tool working behind the scenes to change Quarto documents to their finalized format. Pandoc markdown is very rich and lets you control your document in very specific ways while being easy to read and write. We'll cover this as well.
:::

## Quarto Origins

::: incremental
-   Open source project sponsored by RStudio, PBC
-   We've had 10 years of experience with R Markdown
-   But there are a lot of other programming languages...
:::

. . .

Can we reimplement R Markdown such that it's not tied to R?

:::{.notes}
R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R.
:::

## Quarto Goals

::: incremental
-   Create computational documents that hold source code for automation and reproducibility
-   Reduce how difficult it is to make a scientific document
-   Enable "single-source publishing" --- create Word, PDFs, HTML, etc. from one source

:::{.notes}
Quarto sits inside the literate programming world, which mixes narrative in text form with code for formatted outputs like documents and webpages and more. [click] There are lots of literate programming systems that support computation, like R Markdown, Org Mode, Jupyter Book, and now there is Quarto!
:::

## Why a new system?

::: incremental
-   At its core, Quarto is multilingual and independent of computational systems
-   Has expanded upon R Markdown to add new languages and can add more in the future
:::

. . .

Let's bring R Markdown to everybody!

## Why is it called "Quarto"?

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
::: {style="font-size:28px"}
"Quarto is the format of a book or<br>pamphlet produced from full sheets<br>printed with eight pages of text, four to a<br>side, then folded twice to produce four leaves."

--- Wikipedia

:::

::: notes
According to the website, the developers wanted to use a name that had meaning in the history of publishing and ulitimately landed on Quarto. A quarto is an 8-page double-sided booklet, made by folding a single sheet of paper into four sections.

::: notes
Quarto can make very flexible websites, or books which are a a Quarto website that can be rendered to Word, ePub, etc., blogs with listings and posts and RSS feeds, Quarto has deep feature set for presentations with reveal.js optimized for scientific content, and of course, publishing for journals.
:::

## Quarto Engines

### knitr

![](images/knitr-engine.png)

::: notes
This is the underlying structure that creates documents from the source, the Quarto markdown file or the QMD file. When we render a Quarto document, first, the knitr engine executes all of the code chunks and generates an intermediary markdown file that includes both the code and code output. Then that markdown file is processed by pandoc to create the finished document. Since it uses knitr, most Rmd files can be used unmodified.

    ## Meet Quarto

    Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

    ```{{r}}
    #| label: plot-penguins
    #| echo: false
    #| message: false
    #| warning: false

    library(tidyverse)
    library(palmerpenguins)

    ggplot(penguins, 
           aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
      geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
      scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
      labs(
        title = "Flipper and bill length",
        subtitle = "Dimensions for penguins at Palmer Station LTER",
        x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Bill length (mm)",
        color = "Penguin species", shape = "Penguin species"
      ) +
      theme_minimal()
    ```

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/knitr-plot.png)
:::
:::

::: notes
This is a Quarto document with the extension .qmd (on the left) along with its rendered version as HTML (on the right). You could also choose to render it into other formats like PDF, MS Word, etc. This is the basic model for Quarto publishing---take a source document and render it to a variety of output formats.
:::

## Quarto Engines

### Jupyter

![](images/jupyter-engine.png)

::: notes
The structure is similar for Jupyter, we just are running documents natively through the Jupyter engine. Right now, there's a lot of Quarto functionality for Python and Julia through Jupyter. But, this is part of the multilingualism that we discussed earlier, where you can keep adding languages if you swap out different engines. This also means you can have a shared syntax and format across languages, since the backend is the same.

::: notes
Quarto has native support for Observable JS, a set of enhancements to vanilla JS. It has reactive runtime, so you can interactively work with data within your Quarto document. There are other options too, like htmlwidgets and Shiny for Python.
:::

## Why Quarto?

### A unified ecosystem

::: incremental
-   R Markdown has a lot of packages doing lots of different things
-   Quarto has a shared expression for core features
:::

. . .

Example: Theming

-   Universal theming system based on SCSS for all HTML output

:::{.notes}
Quarto has a shared expression for core features.
For example, Quarto has a universal theming system based on SCSS for all HTML output where core variables defined by bslib  and so it is compatible with Shiny, flexdashboard, and R Markdown themes.
:::

## Why Quarto? {.scrollable}

### New features

-   Cross references
-   Advanced layout
-   Figure/layout panels
-   Callouts
-   Diagrams
-   Extensions
-   Interactivity
-   YAML intelligence
-   Publishing
-   Conditional content
-   Notebook filters

:::{.notes}
R Markdown isn't going away but big new features will be in Quarto, things like YAML intelligence, figure panels, layouts, which we'll cover later in the session.

:::

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto render
```

::: notes
Part of the multilingualism of Quarto is that you are not tied to one tool. Quarto is meant for collaboration either within data science teams or across data science teams. So if someone is familiar with Jupyter Lab, but someone else likes to work in RStudio, they can still work on the same Quarto documents without having to switch to one tool or the other.

For RStudio users, Quarto is bundled and preinstalled with v2022.07 and later. We didn't want to limit Quarto enhancements to just RStudio. VS Code has an extension so you can YAML completion and linting and other features for writing Quarto documents.
:::

## Working in RStudio {.small}

### Rendering

Use the Render button (![](images/rstudio-render-button.png){width="25" height="20"}) in the RStudio IDE to render the file and preview the output with a single click or keyboard shortcut (<kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>K</kbd>).

![](images/rstudio-render.png)

Automatically render on save by checking the Render on Save option:

![](images/rstudio-render-on-save.png) 

::: notes
In RStudio, you can use the Render button to render the file, or take it through that process of convering to markdown, pandoc processing, etc. and preview the output with a single click. If you're familiar with R Markdown, it is where the knit button would show for those document. If you prefer to automatically render whenever you save, you can check the Render on Save option on the editor toolbar. The preview will update whenever you re-render the document. Side-by-side preview works for both HTML and PDF outputs.
:::

---

## YAML Intelligence {.small}

YAML code completion is available for project files, YAML front matter, and executable cell options:

![](images/rstudio-yaml-completion.png){width=400}

If you have incorrect YAML it will also be highlighted when documents are saved:

:::

::: notes
Quarto has YAML intelligence in RStudio and VS code. YAML intelligence means completion and diagnostics for errors, and its' available for project files, YAML front matter, and executable cell options. This makes it easy to write YAML and see
:::

## Working with the RStudio Visual Editor {.small}

![](images/rstudio-source-visual.png)

. . .

::: {style="color: #C04483"}
Let's try it!
:::

::: notes
RStudio has two options for editing documents: visual (on the left) and source (on the right). RStudio's visual editor offers an WYSIWYM authoring experience for markdown. So formatting (e.g. bolding text) you can use the toolbar, a keyboard shortcut (⌘B), or the markdown construct (**bold**). The plain text source code underlying the document is written for you and you can view/edit it at any point by switching to source mode for editing. You can toggle back and forth these two modes by clicking on Source and Visual in the editor toolbar (or using the keyboard shortcut ⌘⇧ F4).

::: {.notes}
A Quarto document contains three types of content: a YAML header, code chunks, and markdown text.
:::

## YAML {.small}

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
![](images/yaml.png)

-   "Yet another markup language"
-   Metadata of your document
-   Demarcated by three dashes (`---`) on either end
-   Uses key-value pairs in the format `key: value`
:::

:::{.notes}
Quarto documents usually start with an (optional) YAML header demarcated by three dashes on either end. The basic syntax of YAML uses key-value pairs in the format key: value. It controls the output of the document and contain metadata for your document, like title and author.
:::

## YAML {.small auto-animate="true"}

``` yaml
---
title: "Penguins, meet Quarto!"

If using the visual editor, you won’t need to learn much markdown syntax for authoring your document as you can use the menus and shortcuts to add a header, bold text, insert a table, etc. If using the source editor, you can achieve these with markdown expressions like ##, **bold**, etc.

::: notes
Pandoc and therefore Quarto can parse fenced Div blocks, which lets you modify the structure of your documents. You can add classes, attributes, and other identifiers to regions of content using Divs and Spans. You can think of divs as HTML divs but can be applied in PDFs or other formats like Word.

## Create a new document

To create a new document in RStudio, go to **File** \> **New File** \> **Quarto Document**:

![](images/new-doc.png){fig-align="center"}

:::{.notes}
A new document will be created with the following YAML. This document will be empty so it won't be terribly interesting.

## Quarto Projects

Quarto projects are directories that provide:

::: incremental
* A way to render all or some of the files in a directory with a single command (e.g. `quarto render myproject`).
* A way to share YAML configuration across multiple documents.
* The ability to redirect output artifacts to another directory.
* The ability to freeze rendered output (i.e. don’t re-execute documents unless they have changed).
:::

## Quarto Projects

```{{yaml}}
project:
  output-dir: _output

toc: true
number-sections: true
bibliography: references.bib  
  
format:
  html:
    css: styles.css
    html-math-method: katex
  pdf:
    documentclass: report
    margin-left: 30mm
    margin-right: 30mm
```

::: notes
Within a Quarto project, you can render all the files at once or specify specific ones to render. So, say you have a website and you want to change the theme throughout, rather than rendering individual pages you can do that all with one command in a project.
Quarto projects also include a _quarto.yml configuration file so that every document in the project inherits the metadata in that file. So, if you think about a blog, you probably want all your posts to have the same theme. If you use the Quarto command for making a new blog, it will automatically be a project, and you can configure the theme for all pages in the _quarto.yml file.
:::

## Quarto Projects

### Freeze

```{{yaml}}
execute:
  freeze: true  # never re-render during project render
```

<br>
```{{yaml}}
execute:
  freeze: auto  # re-render only when source changes
```

::: notes
Rendering a bunch of files can be quite time consuming depending on the computations required. The freeze option specifies if computational documents should never be re-rendered during a global project render, or only be re-rendered when their source file changes. Freeze can used when you have either a large number of collaborators or many computational documents created over a long period of time. In these cases, it can be challenging to fully re-execute every document when you render the site. This could be because some documents have environment-specific requirements or one of your teammates wrote something in Python, which you don't have installed. Using freeze ensures that you can always reproducibly render your site.

Use these themes under the `theme` option in the YAML:

```{{yaml}}
format:
  html:
    theme: flatly
```

:::{layout-ncol=2}

![](images/theme-1.png){width=300}

![](images/theme-2.png){width=300}

:::

## HTML Theming

You can do extensive additional customization using SASS theme files. 

* Bootstrap defines over 1,400 variables that control fonts, colors, padding, borders, and much more!

```{{css}}
/*-- scss:defaults --*/

$body-bg: #CDEEFD;

/*-- scss:rules --*/
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  text-shadow: -1px -1px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, .3);
}
```

## HTML Theming

Provide the custom theme under `theme`:

```{{yaml}}
theme:
  - flatly
  - custom.scss
```

. . .

![](images/theme-3.png){width=300}

## HTML Theming

Quarto also allows you to use a dark and light theme.

```{{yaml}}
theme:
  light: flatly
  dark: darkly
```

:::{layout-ncol=2}

![](images/theme-light.png){width=300}

![](images/theme-dark.png){width=300}
